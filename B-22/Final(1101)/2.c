2. a) Distinguish between ++m and m++ operators [07 Marks]
Both ++m and m++ are increment operators, but they behave differently:


Operator	        Type Meaning	                                                Returns
++m	Pre-increment	Increments the value of m before using it in the expression	    New value of m
m++	Post-increment	Uses the value of m in the expression before incrementing it	Original value of m
Example:
int m = 5;
int a = ++m; // m becomes 6, then a = 6
int b = m++; // b = 6, then m becomes 7

2. b) Which of the following are invalid variable names and why? [16 Marks]
i) minimum ‚úÖ Valid
All lowercase, starts with a letter, no special characters.

ii) first.name ‚ùå Invalid
Dot (.) is not allowed in variable names in C.

iii) 2num_2 ‚ùå Invalid
Cannot start with a digit. Starts with 2.

iv) @name ‚ùå Invalid
@ is a special character, not allowed in identifiers.

v) doubles ‚úÖ Valid
Though it resembles a keyword, it's not (e.g., double is a keyword, not doubles).

vi) int ‚ùå Invalid
int is a reserved keyword in C.

vii) _no ‚úÖ Valid
Variables can start with an underscore.

viii) float ‚ùå Invalid
float is a reserved keyword in C.

2. c) Show the output of the following program: [12 Marks]

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a = 60, b = 9, c = 3;
    printf("a>>1 = %d\n", (a >> c));
    printf("b<<1 = %d", (b << c));
    return 0;
}
Let‚Äôs evaluate it step by step:

Variables:
a = 60, b = 9, c = 3

First line:
a >> c // Right shift 60 by 3 bits
60 in binary: 0011 1100

Shifting right by 3 bits: 0000 0111 ‚Üí 7

So output: a>>1 = 7

Note: a >> c shifts a right by 3 bits (even though it says a>>1, it's actually a >> c, and c = 3).

Second line:
b << c // Left shift 9 by 3 bits
9 in binary: 0000 1001

Shifting left by 3 bits: 0100 1000 ‚Üí 72

So output: b<<1 = 72

‚úÖ Final Output:
a>>1 = 7
b<<1 = 72

/*üîπ Q2 a) Why do we need to use comments in programs? [7 Marks]
Answer: Comments in C are used to:

Explain code logic ‚Äì makes it easier for others (or yourself) to understand later.

Improve readability ‚Äì separates logic into understandable parts.

Debugging aid ‚Äì allows temporarily disabling code without deleting.

Documentation ‚Äì helps maintainers understand the design or purpose of the code.

Example:

// This function calculates factorial
int factorial(int n) { ... }




üîπ Q2 b) Distinguish between while and do-while loops [8 Marks]
Feature                     | while Loop | do-while Loop
Condition Check             | Before executing the loop body                | After executing the loop body
Minimum Executions          | 0 times (may not run at all)                  | At least 1 time (runs once before check)
Syntax                      | while (condition) { ... }                     | do { ... } while (condition);
Use Case                    | When the condition must be true to run        | When the loop must run at least once
Control Type                | Entry-controlled loop                         | Exit-controlled loop
Semicolon After Condition   | ‚ùå Not required                               | ‚úÖ Required (while (...);)
Common Use                  | Input validation, reading until condition     | Menu-driven programs, retry mechanisms
Example:

// while
int i = 5;
while(i < 5) {
    printf("While\n"); // Won't execute
    i++;
}

// do-while
int j = 5;
do {
    printf("Do-While\n"); // Will execute once
    j++;
} while(j < 5);



üîπ Q2 c) Program for piecewise function using if-statement [10 Marks]
Function:
ùë¶={ 1   for¬†ùë•<0
    0   for¬†ùë•=0
    ‚àí1  for¬†ùë•>0
    }

‚úÖ Code:


#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x, y;

    printf("Enter value of x: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);

    if (x < 0)
        y = 1;
    else if (x == 0)
        y = 0;
    else
        y = -1;

    printf("y = %d\n", y);

    return 0;
}



üîπ Q2 d) Identify errors in array declaration statements [10 Marks]
Let's analyze each:

int score [100]; ‚Äì ‚úÖ Valid

float values [10,15]; ‚Äì ‚ùå Invalid, comma not allowed. Use single size: float values[10];

char name[15]; ‚Äì ‚úÖ Valid

float average[5],12; ‚Äì ‚ùå Invalid, 12 is not valid syntax. Should be: float average[5];

double salary[1+4]; ‚Äì ‚úÖ Valid, expressions allowed in array size.
