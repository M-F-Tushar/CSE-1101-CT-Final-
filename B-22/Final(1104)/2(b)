✅ Question 2(b): Uses of Excel Functions
1️⃣ RANDBETWEEN(bottom, top)
Generates a random whole number between two numbers you define.

✅ Example:

=RANDBETWEEN(1, 100)
➡ Gives a random number from 1 to 100. Changes each time the sheet recalculates.

2️⃣ ROUNDOWN(number, num_digits)
Rounds a number down towards zero, keeping a specific number of decimal places.

✅ Example:
=ROUNDDOWN(3.987, 2)
➡ Output: 3.98

3️⃣ SUMPRODUCT(array1, [array2], …)
Multiplies corresponding elements in arrays and returns the sum of those products.

✅ Example:
=SUMPRODUCT(A2:A4, B2:B4)
➡ If A2:A4 = {2,3,4} and B2:B4 = {5,6,7},
It calculates (2×5) + (3×6) + (4×7) = 56

4️⃣ SUBSTITUTE(text, old_text, new_text, [instance_num])
Replaces specific text within a string.

✅ Example:
=SUBSTITUTE("I like cats", "cats", "dogs")
➡ Output: "I like dogs"

You can also replace only the 2nd or 3rd instance of a word using the optional 4th argument.
