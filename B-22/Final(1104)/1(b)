✅ Question 1(b): Count students with marks ≥ 70 using SUMPRODUCT
You are given a list of marks (Column B) and asked to count how many students scored at least 70 marks.

Step-by-step:
Assuming the marks are in cells B2:B12, write the formula in E2:

=SUMPRODUCT(--(B2:B12 >= 70))
Explanation:
B2:B12 >= 70: Creates a TRUE/FALSE array.

--: Converts TRUE/FALSE to 1/0.

SUMPRODUCT: Adds up the 1s, giving the total count of students scoring ≥ 70.
