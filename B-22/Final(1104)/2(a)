âœ… Question 2(a): Relative vs Absolute Reference in Microsoft Excel
ðŸ”¹ Relative Reference:
This is the default type of reference in Excel.
When you copy a formula from one cell to another, the reference changes based on its new position.

âœ… Example:
In cell C2:

=A2 + B2
If you copy this to cell C3, it will change to:

=A3 + B3
âž¡ Useful when you're applying the same formula across multiple rows or columns.

ðŸ”¹ Absolute Reference:
This locks the reference to a specific cell. You use the dollar sign ($) to lock either the row, column, or both.

âœ… Example:
=$A$2 + B2
Even if you copy this down to C3, it still remains:

=$A$2 + B3
âž¡ Useful when you're referring to a fixed cell, like a constant value or grade scale.
