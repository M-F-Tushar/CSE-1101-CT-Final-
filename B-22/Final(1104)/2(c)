✅ Question 1(c): Explain the SUMPRODUCT formulas
Given Table:
A	            B
Date of Sales	Quantity
14 Dec, 2023	60
28 Dec, 2023	75
11 Jan, 2024	55
25 Jan, 2024	82
01 Feb, 2024	90
(i) Formula:
=SUMPRODUCT(--(MONTH(A2:A6)=1))
Explanation:
MONTH(A2:A6): Extracts month number from each date.

=1: Checks if the month is January.

--: Converts TRUE/FALSE to 1/0.

SUMPRODUCT: Adds up all the 1s.

✅ Result: Counts how many sales occurred in January.

(ii) Formula:
=SUMPRODUCT(--(MONTH(A2:A6)=1), B2:B6)
Explanation:
Same as above, but also multiplies the 1s with the values in B2:B6.

Effectively sums the sales quantities in January.

✅ Result: Total quantity sold in January.
