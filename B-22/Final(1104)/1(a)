✅ Question 1(a): Calculate letter grade using HLOOKUP
Given Table Structure:
Marks to Grade Scale:

Marks	0	60	70	80
Grade	F	D	B	A
This scale is shown in cells H3 to K4.

Goal:
Use the HLOOKUP function to calculate the Letter Grade for each student based on their marks.

Step-by-step:
Suppose you want to calculate the grade for the first student (row 2), whose marks are in cell B2. Use the following formula in C2 (Letter Grade column):

=HLOOKUP(B2, $H$3:$K$4, 2, TRUE)
Explanation:
B2: The value to look up (student’s marks).

$H$3:$K$4: The table array for HLOOKUP.

2: Row number in the table array to return the value from (Grade row).

TRUE: Allows approximate match (works like ranges).

Repeat this formula for each row (e.g., C3 will use B3 instead of B2).
