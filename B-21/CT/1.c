Identifiers are the names used to identify variables, functions, arrays, and other user-defined elements in a C program. The rules for identifiers are:

Must start with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or an underscore (_) but cannot start with a digit (0-9).

Can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_) but no special characters (e.g., @, #, $).

Cannot be a C keyword (e.g., int, float, return).

C is case-sensitive, meaning Variable and variable are different identifiers.

Must not exceed compiler-defined length limits (usually 31 characters for portability).
