
a) Why is a recursive function better than a loop? (10 Marks)
Point	                                Explanation
Simplicity	                            Recursive solutions are often shorter and clearer for problems that have a natural recursive structure (like tree traversal, factorial, Fibonacci, etc.).
Easier to Think (for some problems)	    Some problems (like solving a maze, calculating factorial, tree/graph problems) are easier to solve by thinking recursively, because they naturally involve repeating smaller versions of the problem.
Reduces Code Complexity	                In some cases, recursion can reduce the number of lines of code and avoid writing complex loops.
Better for Dividing Problems	        Recursive functions naturally break a big problem into smaller subproblems (divide and conquer), which is perfect for problems like quicksort, mergesort.
Elegant for Data Structures	            Recursive functions are perfect for trees, graphs, linked lists, etc., because their structure itself is recursive.
Example:

int factorial(int n) {
    if(n == 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
However:

It uses more stack memory.

May be slower than loops for very large problems.

b) Briefly explain call by value and call by reference with proper examples. (12 Marks)
Call by Value:

A copy of the actual argument is passed.

Changes made in the function do not affect the original value.

void modify(int a) {
    a = 10;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    modify(x);
    printf("%d", x);  // Output: 5
}
Call by Reference:

The address (reference) of the argument is passed.

Changes made in the function affect the original variable.

void modify(int *a) {
    *a = 10;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    modify(&x);
    printf("%d", x);  // Output: 10
}
c) Show the output of the following program: (13 Marks)

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int func(int c) {
    if(c == 0)
        return c;
    else {
        int value = func(c - 1);
        printf("%d ", value);
        return c;
    }
}

int main() {
    int x = func(5);
    printf("%d", x);
}
/*
🔁 Manual Iteration (Call Stack Simulation):
We'll trace each function call from main().

➤ main() calls func(5)
c = 5, not 0 → go to else

call func(4)

➤ func(4)
c = 4, not 0 → call func(3)

➤ func(3)
c = 3, not 0 → call func(2)

➤ func(2)
c = 2, not 0 → call func(1)

➤ func(1)
c = 1, not 0 → call func(0)

➤ func(0)
c == 0, so return 0 (base case)

Now we go back up the stack, step by step.

⬅️ Back to func(1)
Got value = 0 from func(0)

print 0

return 1

⬅️ Back to func(2)
Got value = 1

print 1

return 2

⬅️ Back to func(3)
Got value = 2

print 2

return 3

⬅️ Back to func(4)
Got value = 3

print 3

return 4

⬅️ Back to func(5)
Got value = 4

print 4

return 5

⬅️ Back to main()
Got x = 5 from func(5)

print 5

✅ Final Output:
0 1 2 3 4 5

Edit
func(5)
 └── func(4)
      └── func(3)
           └── func(2)
                └── func(1)
                     └── func(0) → returns 0
                ← prints 0, returns 1
           ← prints 1, returns 2
      ← prints 2, returns 3
  ← prints 3, returns 4
← prints 4, returns 5
main() prints 5
